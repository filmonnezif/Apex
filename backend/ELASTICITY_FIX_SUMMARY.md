# Elasticity Model Fix - Summary

## Problem Solved
âœ… **Fixed the elasticity model feature mismatch issue**

The elasticity model was trained on data with specific categorical features, but the API was trying to use it with differently encoded features, causing "Dimension mis-match" errors.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Created Feature Schema File** (`elasticity_feature_info.pkl`)
   - Extracted the exact feature names and encoding from the training data
   - Saved it alongside the model for consistent feature alignment
   - Contains 18 features including one-hot encoded categorical variables

### 2. **Updated ElasticityService** (`services/elasticity_service.py`)
   - Now loads both the model AND the feature schema
   - Automatically aligns features during prediction
   - Handles missing categorical values by adding zero columns
   - Reorders features to match training schema

### 3. **Key Features Saved**:
```
1. month                                    (numeric)
2. day_of_week                              (numeric)
3. is_weekend                               (numeric)
4. is_holiday                               (numeric)
5. rolling_7day_mean                        (numeric)
6. rolling_7day_std                         (numeric)
7. promotion_NON-PROMOTION                  (one-hot)
8. category_ICE COFFEE                      (one-hot)
9. category_MUESLI / CEREAL & NUTRITIONAL BAR (one-hot)
10. category_PET CARE                        (one-hot)
11. category_TOTAL COFFEE                    (one-hot)
12. brand_NESTLE                             (one-hot)
13. brand_PURINA FRISKIES                    (one-hot)
14. store_type_Hypermarket                   (one-hot)
15. store_type_Mini Market                   (one-hot)
16. store_type_Online                        (one-hot)
17. store_type_Supermarket                   (one-hot)
18. store_type_Traditional                   (one-hot)
```

## Test Results

### All 7 Tests PASSED (100%)
1. âœ… Model Loading - Model and feature schema load correctly
2. âœ… Data Loading - Historical data loads successfully
3. âœ… Covariate Preparation - Features align with model schema
4. âœ… Elasticity Calculation - Correct elasticities computed
5. âœ… Demand Prediction - Demand predictions work correctly
6. âœ… Profit Optimization - Optimization finds profit-maximizing prices
7. âœ… API Integration - Full end-to-end API works

### Example Results
**Product: NESTLE NESQUIK 330GR(C) BOX**
- Current Price: AED 3.68
- Optimal Price: AED 4.60 (+25.0%)
- Elasticity: -0.173 (inelastic)
- Profit Improvement: +89.0%
- Reasoning: Product has inelastic demand, so price increase improves margins more than it reduces volume

## Files Modified
1. **services/elasticity_service.py** - Updated to use feature schema
2. **elasticity_feature_info.pkl** - NEW: Feature schema file
3. **extract_feature_info.py** - NEW: Script to create feature schema

## Key Improvements
- âœ… No more "Dimension mis-match" errors
- âœ… Elasticity model now uses the existing trained weights
- âœ… Consistent feature encoding between training and prediction
- âœ… Proper handling of categorical variables
- âœ… Product-specific elasticity estimates from EconML model
- âœ… Realistic profit-maximizing price recommendations

## API Status
ðŸŸ¢ **FULLY OPERATIONAL**
- Both XGBoost demand model and EconML elasticity model loaded
- Price optimization endpoint working correctly
- Returns profit-maximizing prices with elasticity analysis
- Provides demand curves and detailed reasoning

## No Retraining Required
The original trained model weights (`price_elasticity_model.pkl`) are being used.
We only added a feature schema file to ensure consistent encoding.
